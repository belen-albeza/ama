I get a lot of questions by email and Twitter. This way anyone can read the answer!

Anything means *anything*, with a few exceptions. You can freely ask me about games, work, life, tech, etc.

**Tambi√©n puedes preguntarme en castellano**.

### Guidelines

- Ensure your question hasn't already been answered.
- Use a succinct title and description.
